 *
 * For the ring buffer, 64 bit required operations for the time is
 * the following:
 *
 *  - Reads may fail if it interrupted a modification of the time stamp.
 *      It will succeed if it did not interrupt another write even if
 *      the read itself is interrupted by a write.
 *      It returns whether it was successful or not.
 *
 *  - Writes always succeed and will overwrite other writes and writes
 *      that were done by events interrupting the current write.
 *
 *  - A write followed by a read of the same time stamp will always succeed,
 *      but may not contain the same value.
 *
 *  - A cmpxchg will fail if it interrupted another write or cmpxchg.
 *      Other than that, it acts like a normal cmpxchg.
 *
 * The 60 bit time stamp is broken up by 30 bits in a top and bottom half
 *  (bottom being the least significant 30 bits of the 60 bit time stamp).

/*
 * Making the ring buffer lockless makes things tricky.
 * Although writes only happen on the CPU that they are on,
 * and they only need to worry about interrupts. Reads can
 * happen on any CPU.
 *
 * The reader page is always off the ring buffer, but when the
 * reader finishes with a page, it needs to swap its page with
 * a new one from the buffer. The reader needs to take from
 * the head (writes go to the tail). But if a writer is in overwrite
 * mode and wraps, it must push the head page forward.
 *
 * Here lies the problem.
 *
 * The reader must be careful to replace only the head page, and
 * not another one. As described at the top of the file in the
 * ASCII art, the reader sets its old page to point to the next
 * page after head. It then sets the page after head to point to
 * the old reader page. But if the writer moves the head page
 * during this operation, the reader could end up with the tail.
 *
 * We use cmpxchg to help prevent this race. We also do something
 * special with the page before head. We set the LSB to 1.
 *
 * When the writer must push the page forward, it will clear the
 * bit that points to the head page, move the head, and then set
 * the bit that points to the new head page.
 *
 * We also don't want an interrupt coming in and moving the head
 * page on another writer. Thus we use the second LSB to catch
 * that too. Thus:
 *
 * head->list->prev->next        bit 1          bit 0
 *                              -------        -------
 * Normal page                     0              0
 * Points to head page             0              1
 * New head page                   1              0
 *
 * Note we can not trust the prev pointer of the head page, because:
 *
 * +----+       +-----+        +-----+
 * |    |------>|  T  |---X--->|  N  |
 * |    |<------|     |        |     |
 * +----+       +-----+        +-----+
 *   ^                           ^ |
 *   |          +-----+          | |
 *   +----------|  R  |----------+ |
 *              |     |<-----------+
 *              +-----+
 *
 * Key:  ---X-->  HEAD flag set in pointer
 *         T      Tail page
 *         R      Reader page
 *         N      Next page
 *
 * (see __tb_reserve_next() to see where this happens)
 *
 *  What the above shows is that the reader just swapped out
 *  the reader page with a page in the buffer, but before it
 *  could make the new header point back to the new page added
 *  it was preempted by a writer. The writer moved forward onto
 *  the new page added by the reader and is about to move forward
 *  again.
 *
 *  You can see, it is legitimate for the previous pointer of
 *  the head (or any page) not to point back to itself. But only
 *  temporarily.

/*
 * The lock and unlock are done within a preempt disable section.
 * The current_context per_cpu variable can only be modified
 * by the current task between lock and unlock. But it can
 * be modified more than once via an interrupt. To pass this
 * information from the lock to the unlock without having to
 * access the 'in_interrupt()' functions again (which do show
 * a bit of overhead in something as critical as function tracing,
 * we use a bitmask trick.
 *
 *  bit 1 =  NMI context
 *  bit 2 =  IRQ context
 *  bit 3 =  SoftIRQ context
 *  bit 4 =  normal context.
 *
 * This works because this is the order of contexts that can
 * preempt other contexts. A SoftIRQ never preempts an IRQ
 * context.
 *
 * When the context is determined, the corresponding bit is
 * checked and set (if it was set, then a recursion of that context
 * happened).
 *
 * On unlock, we need to clear this bit. To do so, just subtract
 * 1 from the current_context and AND it to itself.
 *
 * (binary)
 *  101 - 1 = 100
 *  101 & 100 = 100 (clearing bit zero)
 *
 *  1010 - 1 = 1001
 *  1010 & 1001 = 1000 (clearing bit 1)
 *
 * The least significant bit can be cleared this way, and it
 * just so happens that it is the same bit corresponding to
 * the current context.
 *
 * Now the TRANSITION bit breaks the above slightly. The TRANSITION bit
 * is set when a recursion is detected at the current context, and if
 * the TRANSITION bit is already set, it will fail the recursion.
 * This is needed because there's a lag between the changing of
 * interrupt context and updating the preempt count. In this case,
 * a false positive will be found. To handle this, one extra recursion
 * is allowed, and this is done by the TRANSITION bit. If the TRANSITION
 * bit is already set, then it is considered a recursion and the function
 * ends. Otherwise, the TRANSITION bit is set, and that bit is returned.
 *
 * On the tb_recursive_unlock(), the TRANSITION bit will be the first
 * to be cleared. Even if it wasn't the context that set it. That is,
 * if an interrupt comes in while NORMAL bit is set and the ring buffer
 * is called before preempt_count() is updated, since the check will
 * be on the NORMAL bit, the TRANSITION bit will then be set. If an
 * NMI then comes in, it will set the NMI bit, but when the NMI code
 * does the tb_recursive_unlock() it will clear the TRANSITION bit
 * and leave the NMI bit set. But this is fine, because the interrupt
 * code that set the TRANSITION bit will then clear the NMI bit when it
 * calls tb_recursive_unlock(). If another NMI comes in, it will
 * set the TRANSITION bit and continue.
 *
 * Note: The TRANSITION bit only handles a single transition between context.
